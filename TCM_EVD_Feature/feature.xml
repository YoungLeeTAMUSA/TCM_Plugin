      Dear Developer,

I was wondering if you could spend some minutes of your precious time by helping me. As part of my dissertation entitled &quot;Early Vulnerability Detection for Supporting Secure Programming&quot;, I developed an Eclipse plug-in (still just a prototype) that performs security vulnerability detection while the developer is creating/editing the source code.

You can install the plug-in as you usually do when working with Eclipse, however, if you have any doubts on &quot;How to Install the plug-in&quot;, there is a How-To at: http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~lsampaio/plugin/early_vulnerability_detector/Tutorial.

The plug-in&apos;s link:
http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~lsampaio/plugin/early_vulnerability_detector/latest/

You can test the plug-in with some of your own projects, however, if you want you can download, import and test a sample project created by me which contains dozens of known security vulnerabilities. More about this project in the attached pdf.

The sample&apos;s link:
http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~lsampaio/plugin/early_vulnerability_detector/latest/WebDemo.zip

I would really appreciate your feedback on regards to ANYTHING. The images used, the text to inform the vulnerabilities, the options provided by the plug-in, the English words, false positives, false negatives and anything else that comes to your mind.

Thank you in advance,
Luciano Sampaio
